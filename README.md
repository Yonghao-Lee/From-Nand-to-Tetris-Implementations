# From Nand to Tetris – Implementations

Projects and implementations from the **Nand to Tetris** course.  
Covers building a computer from the ground up: logic gates, CPU, assembler, VM translator, and compiler stages.

## Structure

- `projects/` – Implementations from each course project (1–12)  
- `hdl/` – Hardware modules (e.g., ALU, CPU, Memory) in HDL  
- `assembler/`, `vm/`, `compiler/` – Software toolchain components in Python
- `tests/` – Test scripts and comparison files

## Tools Used

- **Hardware Simulator** (provided by course)  
- **Python for translator and compiler parts  
- Platform: macOS/Linux
